C++:
    Allocators
    C Library
    Streams
    Strings
    Diagnostics: are provided to deal with exceptions
    Numerics
    Locales: facilitate internationalization
    STL:
        Containers
        Iterators
        Algorithms
        Adaptors: are objects that change an interface
        Functors
        Utilities
 
 Container:
    sequence:
        vector
        list
        deque
    associate sequence:
        set
        map
        multiset
        multimap
 
 vector:
    behaves like an array, but can grow itself as necessary.
    size: already in vector
    capacity: the number of elements the vector can hold before reallocating
    
Iterators:
    provide a way of specifying a position in a container.
